# N-Body Problem Python Simulation

![logo](imgs/black_logo2.png)

A simple Python-based simulation of the three-body problem using Pygame.


## Introduction

This Python code provides a basic simulation of the three-body problem, which is a classical problem in physics and celestial mechanics. The simulation uses Pygame for visualization and allows you to observe the interactions between three celestial bodies under the influence of gravitational forces.

## Features

- Simulate the motion of three celestial bodies under gravity.
- Customize initial conditions and parameters.
- Observe the dynamic behavior of the n-body system.
- Add more bodies to see how do they all interact with each other

## Requirements

To run this code, you need:

    Python 3.x

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fer14/n-body-problem
```

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd n-body-problem
``````

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the simulation:

```bash
python app.py
```

Observe the three-body simulation and interact with it using Pygame's window. By clicking in the space you will add more bodies to the simulation

## Customization

You can customize the simulation by editing the following parameters in the code:

- Initial positions and velocities of the particles in main.py.
- Gravitational constant (G) and masses of the particles in main.py.
- Screen dimensions and simulation settings in main.py.

Feel free to experiment with different initial conditions and parameters to observe various behaviors of the three-body system.
